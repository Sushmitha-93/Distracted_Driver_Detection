Distracted driving is causing about 3000 deaths and 280,000 injuries per year according to National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration (NHTSA). Unfortunately distracted driving has become all too common these days with advent of smart phones and social media.

Computer vision solutions based on machine learning image classification algorithms can be effectively used to detect inattentive drivers using any sort of dashboard cameras and alert drivers.

### Demo
<b>Backend:</b> FastAPI to take image as requests and respond with prediction result using trained Resnet ML model to make predictions. FastAPI Docker container image is deployed and hosted on Heroku.

<b>Frontend:</b> ReactJS application, Hosted on GitHub pages.

Check out Phase 1 demo which uses the trained Renet-50 model to predict unlabelled test images
